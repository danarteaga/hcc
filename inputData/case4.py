Additional Labs &amp; Studies
Labs from 2/21/23: SCr 1.6, eGFR 37, Hgb 14.6, A1c 6.2%, UACR 287, TSH 49.7.
Kidney US 6/21/16 shows atrophic right kidney with cortical thinning with R 7.3 cm and L 11 cm.
Echo 1/24/23 shows moderate LVE with paradoxical septal motion and EF 30% with severe LVSD with
global hypokinesis and severe MR and moderately elevated RVSP.
CTA CAP 1/26/23 shows:

1.  Moderate cardiomegaly with stable postoperative changes as above;
stable mild pulmonary artery enlargement, likely related to pulmonary artery hypertension.
2.  Small right pleural effusion with mild bibasilar atelectasis; no
pulmonary consolidation or pulmonary edema.
3.  Diffuse thoracoabdominal atheromatous changes with patent stented
proximal celiac and SMA.  Diffuse scattered SMA branch disease, with
moderate narrowing of the SMA trunk at the level of middle colic
artery takeoff with moderately severe middle colic artery origin narrowing.
4.  Chronic inferior mesenteric artery occlusion, unchanged, with
collateral left colic branch filling.
5.  No CT evidence of small bowel or colonic ischemia.
6.  Stable appearance of iliofemoral artery disease with chronic
right external iliac occlusion and patent femoral crossover graft.
7.  New, small abdominal and pelvic ascites and diffuse
retroperitoneal stranding and body wall edema compared with 2022.
8.  Cholelithiasis; mild gallbladder wall fluid/edema adjacent to the
liver surface, favored to be associated with anasarca and/or passive
hepatic congestion rather than acute cholecystitis.
