Step 1. Determine the Extent of Stroke Injury for the Patient.

First, determine if the stroke has affected both limbs (i.e. arm and leg) on one side or just one limb (i.e. arm or leg, but not both). If the stroke has led to weakness of both limbs, the appropriate term to use is "hemiplegia and hemiparesis". If the stroke has led to weakness of just one limb, the appropriate term to use is "monoplegia." If there is limb weakness but it is unclear what is affected, "other paralytic syndrome" should be used.

Hemiplegia and hemiparesis

Monoplegia

Other paralytic syndrome

Step 2. Determine the Side that is Affected by Stroke.

Next, determine if the stroke has affected the left or the right side. Of note, while most people are "right dominant", some individuals are "left dominant." If the side of dominance is not available but the side is available (i.e. left or right), then assume "right dominant". If no side is specified, use "unspecified side."

Right dominant side

Right non-dominant side

Left dominant side

Left non-dominant side

Unspecified side

Following Step 1 and Step 2, a single code description can be created. For example:

Monoplegia of upper limb following cerebral infarction affecting right non-dominant side

Hemiplegia and hemiparesis following cerebral infarction affecting left dominant side

Monoplegia of upper limb following unspecified cerebrovascular disease affecting unspecified side

Step 3. Determine the Extent of Artery Blockage.

Next, determine if there was a stenosis (partial blockage) or occlusion (complete blockage) of an artery. If this is unclear, use "unspecified occlusion or stenosis"

Step 4. Determine the Artery that caused the Stroke.

Lastly, separately determine which artery the stroke affected. If this is unclear, use: other cerebral infarction[I63.8].

Carotid artery (left, right, bilateral, or unspecified)

Anterior cerebral artery (left, right, bilateral, or unspecified)

Posterior cerebral artery (left, right, bilateral, or unspecified)

Middle cerebral artery (left, right, bilateral, or unspecified)

Vertebral artery (left, right, bilateral, or unspecified)

Basilar artery

Cerebellar arteries (left, right, bilateral, or unspecified)

Following Step 3 and Step 4, an additional single code description can be created (in addition to the code created from Step 1 and Step 2). For example:

Cerebral infarction due to thrombosis of basilar artery

Cerebral infarction due to embolism of right vertebral artery

Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of unspecified cerebellar artery

Cerebral infarction due to embolism of bilateral middle cerebral arteries
